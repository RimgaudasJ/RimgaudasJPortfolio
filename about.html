        <h4>Software Engineering Student | Game Developer | Aspiring IT Professional</h4>

        <p>
          I am a Software Engineering student with a strong passion for virtual worlds and interactive systems. 
          I have been developing projects from a young age, which has allowed me to build both technical depth 
          and practical experience over time. My primary focus is game development and efficient algorithm design, 
          while also maintaining a broad range of knowledge across different areas of software development.
        </p>

        <p>
          I am a dedicated and hardworking individual who values teamwork, continuous improvement, and delivering 
          high-quality results. I enjoy solving complex problems, taking initiative, and supporting others in 
          collaborative environments.
        </p>

        <p>
          I am currently seeking opportunities in the IT sector. If you are looking for a motivated and adaptable 
          developer — or know someone who is — I would be glad to connect and discuss how I can contribute.
        </p>
